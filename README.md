# NB-Prediction-of-different-datasets
I am building a project that will predict the yes or no of a particular  situation by the given dataset. There are different types of Datasets for  this prediction algorithm. For example, if it is not raining you can go  outside for, in this condition the project will return YES or you can go  play outside. It uses Na√Øve Bayes prediction algorithm to provide an  answer.

Note: Download Pandas and sklearn library to run the code
